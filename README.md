# CLASSIFICATION USING QUANTUM KERNEL


# Introduction
Quantum computing has ushered in a new era of exploration in machine
learning, offering novel tools such as quantum kernels that promise to trans-
form the landscape of data analysis and model development. In this report,
we delve into the principles of quantum kernels, explore the SWAP test as a
key component, and present a comparative analysis of classical and quantum
support vector machine (SVM) classifiers using the Iris dataset.
# Quantum Kernels and Kernel Methods
Kernel methods in classical machine learning leverage kernel functions to
map data points into higher-dimensional feature spaces. In quantum ma-
chine learning, we extend this concept using quantum feature maps to create
quantum kernels. Quantum kernels serve as powerful tools to explore the
overlap and relationships between quantum states, providing a unique per-
spective on data relationships.
# Quantum Feature Maps and Angle Embeddings
Quantum feature maps, such as angle embeddings, encode classical inputs
into quantum states. Angle embeddings use rotation gates (RX, RY , or RZ)
to represent features, with the rotation angles determined by classical input
1
features. These quantum states are crucial in creating a quantum kernel that
captures the essence of the data relationships.
# SWAP Test for Quantum Overlap
The SWAP test plays a pivotal role in quantum kernel calculations. It esti-
mates the squared inner product between two quantum states, providing a
crucial metric for measuring their overlap. The SWAP test is formalized as:


    P(|0⟩) = |⟨0...0|S(x′)†S(x)|0...0⟩|^2
# Quantum Kernel Calculation
The quantum kernel κ(x, x′) is calculated using the squared overlap obtained
from the SWAP test:

    κ(x, x′) = |⟨ϕ(x′)|ϕ(x)⟩|^2
    
This quantum kernel represents the squared inner product between the
quantum states |ϕ(x′)⟩ and |ϕ(x)⟩, offering a quantitative measure of their
similarity.
# Optimizing Qubit Usage with Inverse Embedding
To optimize qubit usage, we apply the inverse embedding with x′ on the same
qubits. The projector onto the initial state |0...0⟩⟨0...0| is then measured,
ensuring the quantum kernel remains accurate: 

     P(|0⟩) = |⟨0...0|S(x′)†S(x)|0...0⟩|^2
To verify the quantum kernel, we incorporate the SWAP test in the calcula-
tion:

           ⟨0...0|S(x′)S(x)†MS(x′)†S(x)|0...0⟩    = ⟨0...0|S(x′)S(x)†|0...0⟩⟨0...0|S(x′)†S(x)|0...0⟩

                                                 = |⟨0...0|S(x′)†S(x)|0...0⟩|^2

                                                 = |⟨ϕ(x′)|ϕ(x)⟩|^2
                                                 
                                                 = κ(x, x′)
This equation confirms that the quantum kernel κ(x, x′) is obtained through
the SWAP test, providing a robust and efficient means of measuring quantum
state overlap.
# Comparative Analysis with Quantum SVM
Moving beyond theoretical considerations, we applied the principles of quan-
tum kernels to enhance classifier performance. A classical SVM model and
a quantum SVM model were trained on the Iris dataset, which contains 150
data points across three classes with four features each.

One potential reason for this can be that kernels play an important role
in the loss function of the SVM classifier. Quantum kernels may perform a
more efficient embedding of the data into a high-dimensional feature space,
capturing intricate relationships that a classical linear kernel might struggle
with.
# Training Methodology
For the classical SVM model, we utilized the scikit-learn library’s SVM algo-
rithm. In contrast, the quantum SVM model leveraged quantum-enhanced
features to create a more robust classifier. The quantum model was trained
using a hybrid approach, combining classical and quantum processing, allow-
ing for improved classification accuracy.
# Conclusion
In conclusion, the integration of quantum kernels and the SWAP test provides
a powerful framework for measuring the overlap and relationships between
quantum states.
The theoretical underpinnings of quantum kernels were
applied practically in the context of classifier enhancement, demonstrating
superior performance of the quantum SVM model on the Iris dataset. The
results underscore the potential of quantum-enhanced algorithms in advanc-
ing machine learning models, paving the way for transformative applications
in data analysis and classification tasks.
# Future Directions
As we continue to explore the capabilities of quantum computing, future
research will focus on scaling quantum kernels for larger datasets and fur-
ther optimizing quantum algorithms. The potential for quantum-enhanced
machine learning models to address complex real-world problems remains a
fascinating avenue for future investigation.
